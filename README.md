# Task Manager

A simple, lightweight **Task Manager web application** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, display, and delete tasks using **localStorage**, ensuring that tasks persist even after refreshing the browser.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Add Tasks**: Enter tasks into the input field and save them with a click.
* **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in the browser’s `localStorage`.
* **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with a single click.
* **Responsive Layout**: Clean, minimal interface styled with CSS.

## 📖 How It Works

* When a user enters a task and clicks **Add New Task**, the input is validated and stored in `localStorage`.
* The app dynamically renders all stored tasks inside the `#output` container.
* Each task has a delete button (`X`), which removes it from both the UI and `localStorage`.
* Styling is handled via `styles.css`, giving the UI a clean, modern look with alternating backgrounds for task rows.
